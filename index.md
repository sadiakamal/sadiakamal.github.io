# Home

I am a PhD Candidate in the department of computer science at [Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu). My work focuses mostly on natural language processing and social network analysis, currently I am interested in understanding and quantifying inherent biases in Large Language Models. I work in the [Reasoning and Artificial Intelligence (rAIson) Laboratory](https://cas.okstate.edu/computer_science/about_us/dr_sen_lab/research_team.html) under the guidance of [Dr. Atriya Sen](https://experts.okstate.edu/atriya.sen) and [Dr. Sagnik Ray Choudhury](https://sagnik.github.io). Welcome to my homepage, where I share my research, publications, and projects.

<h2 id="research-experience">Research Experience</h2>

<div class="research-list">
  <p>— Currently developing fine-tuning strategies to analyze bias shifts in LLMs (LLaMA, GPT, etc.), quantifying the impact of topic-specific and entity-masked training.</p>
  <p>— Developed a bias-mitigated deep learning model for political stance detection in news articles, integrating external knowledge sources. Achieved 73% accuracy, surpassing baselines in unseen domains.</p>
  <p>— Implemented deep learning models (Transformers, Decision Trees, Random Forest), using PyTorch and TensorFlow for classification and regression. Fine-tuned LLMs using LoRA/QLoRA in text and multimodal setups.</p>
