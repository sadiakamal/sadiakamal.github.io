I am a PhD Candidate in the department of computer science at [Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu). My work focuses mostly on natural language processing and social network analysis, currently I am interested in understanding and quantifying inherent biases in Large Language Models. I work in the [Reasoning and Artificial Intelligence (rAIson) Laboratory](https://cas.okstate.edu/computer_science/about_us/dr_sen_lab/research_team.html) under the guidance of [Dr. Atriya Sen](https://experts.okstate.edu/atriya.sen) and [Dr. Sagnik Ray Choudhury](https://sagnik.github.io). Welcome to my homepage, where I share my research, publications, and projects.

# Research Experience
* Currently developing fine-tuning strategies to analyze bias shifts in LLMs(LLaMA, GPT etc.), quantifying the impact of topic-specific and entity-masked training.
* Developed a bias-mitigated deep learning model for political stance detection in news articles, integrating external knowledge sources. Achieved 73% accuracy, surpassing baselines in unseen domains.
* Implemented deep learning models (Transformers, Decision Trees, Random Forest), using PyTorch and TensorFlow for various tasks such as classification and regression. Specially fine-tuned LLMs using optimization techniques such as LoRA, QLoRA in both text and multimodal setups on multiple downstream tasks, with the goal of understanding their reasoning capabilities.

# Teaching Experience & Talks
* Taught High School Teachers Basics of AI & ML as part of RET 2025
* Gave two lectures in Representation Learning course as a guest lecturer
* Gave a guest lecture in artificial intelligence course


# Achievements

* Outstanding CS Scholar Award 2023
* Outstanding CS Leadership Award 2023
* Women in Data Science(WiDS) Stillwater ambassador 2023
* Magna Cum Laude.
* Anwarul Abedin Leadership award(Gold Medal)
