# Research Experience
* Currently developing fine-tuning strategies to analyze bias shifts in LLMs(LLaMA, GPT etc.), quantifying the impact of topic-specific and entity-masked training.
* Developed a bias-mitigated deep learning model for political stance detection in news articles, integrating external knowledge sources. Achieved 73% accuracy, surpassing baselines in unseen domains.
* Implemented deep learning models (Transformers, Decision Trees, Random Forest), using PyTorch and TensorFlow for various tasks such as classification and regression. Specially fine-tuned LLMs using optimization techniques such as LoRA, QLoRA in both text and multimodal setups on multiple downstream tasks, with the goal of understanding their reasoning capabilities.

# Teaching Experience & Talks
