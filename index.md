# About Me

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of computer science](https://cas.okstate.edu/computer_science/) at [Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu). My work focuses mostly on Natural Language Processing and Social Network Analysis, with a current focus on understanding and quantifying inherent biases in Large Language Models. I work in the [Reasoning and Artificial Intelligence (rAIson) Laboratory](https://cas.okstate.edu/computer_science/about_us/dr_sen_lab/research_team.html) under the guidance of [Dr. Atriya Sen](https://experts.okstate.edu/atriya.sen) and [Dr. Sagnik Ray Choudhury](https://sagnik.github.io). Prior to OSU, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [AIUB](https://www.aiub.edu), where I graduated Magna Cum Laude (Silver) and received a Gold Medal for Leadership.

Welcome to my homepage, where I share my research, publications, and latest updates.

<h2 id="research-experience">Research Experience</h2>

<div class="research-list">
  <p>— Currently analyzing robustness of bias measuring techniques to measure inherent biases of open-source LLMs(LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma etc.)</p>
  <p>— Developed a bias-mitigated deep learning model for political stance detection in news articles, integrating external knowledge sources. Achieved 73% accuracy, surpassing baselines in unseen domains.</p>
  <p>— Implemented deep learning models (Transformers, Decision Trees, Random Forest), using PyTorch and TensorFlow for classification and regression. Fine-tuned LLMs using LoRA/QLoRA in text and multimodal setups.</p>
